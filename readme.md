Title
-----

Automatic ultrasonic transducers characterisation test bench

Description
-----------

This test bench is dedicated to the measurement of ultrasonic transducer
performances, such as:

-   experimental identification of the optical focus;

-   characterisation of the sound fieldÂ in two dimensions (for example on a 5 x
    20cm plane);

-   influence of diverse parameters on the measurement quality (tension, length
    of impulse, settings of the analogical acquisition);

-   measurement of the variance of technical characteristics between different
    sensors of a same production batch;

-   geometrical validation/correction of an image captured by a complete probe.

Technical specifications and part list are available [here](../doc/2017-09-01
